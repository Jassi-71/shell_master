Flags used in the code and their functionality.


IN LS COMMAND:

‘-a’
‘--all’
     In directories, do not ignore file names that start with ‘.’.
‘-A’
‘--almost-all’
     In directories, do not ignore all file names that start with ‘.’;
     ignore only ‘.’ and ‘..’.  The ‘--all’ (‘-a’) option overrides this
     option.
'-1'
	print the files one in each line.




IN DATE COMMAND:
‘-u’
‘--utc’
‘--universal’
     Use Universal Time by operating as if the ‘TZ’ environment variable
     were set to the string ‘UTC0’.  UTC stands for Coordinated
     Universal Time, established in 1960.  Universal Time is often
     called “Greenwich Mean Time” (GMT) for historical reasons.
     Typically, systems ignore leap seconds and thus implement an
     approximation to UTC rather than true UTC.
‘-R’
‘--rfc-email’
     Display the date and time using the format ‘%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S
     %z’, evaluated in the C locale so abbreviations are always in
     English.  For example:

          Fri, 09 Sep 2005 13:51:39 -0700
‘-d DATESTR’
‘--date=DATESTR’
     Display the date and time specified in DATESTR instead of the
     current date and time.  DATESTR can be in almost any common format.
     It can contain month names, time zones, ‘am’ and ‘pm’, ‘yesterday’,
     etc.  For example, ‘--date="2004-02-27 14:19:13.489392193 +0530"’
     specifies the instant of time that is 489,392,193 nanoseconds after
     February 27, 2004 at 2:19:13 PM in a time zone that is 5 hours and
     30 minutes east of UTC.




IN CAT COMMAND
‘-E’
‘--show-ends’
     Display a ‘$’ after the end of each line.
‘-n’
‘--number’
     Number all output lines, starting with 1.  This option is ignored
     if ‘-b’ is in effect.




IN HISTORY COMMAND
-c 			reinitialises the history, clears all the space in history
"number"	prints last "number" lines of the history 




IN RMDIR COMMAND
‘-p’
‘--parents’
     Remove DIRECTORY, then try to remove each component of DIRECTORY.
     So, for example, ‘rmdir -p a/b/c’ is similar to ‘rmdir a/b/c a/b
     a’.  As such, it fails if any of those directories turns out not to
     be empty.  Use the ‘--ignore-fail-on-non-empty’ option to make it
     so such a failure does not evoke a diagnostic and does not cause
     ‘rmdir’ to exit unsuccessfully.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Give a diagnostic for each successful removal.  DIRECTORY is
     removed.




IN MKDIR COMMAND
‘-p’
‘--parents’
     Make any missing parent directories for each argument, setting
     their file permission bits to the umask modified by ‘u+wx’.  Ignore
     existing parent directories, and do not change their file
     permission bits.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Print a message for each created directory.  This is most useful
     with ‘--parents’.


IN CD COMMAND
help 	tells in brief about the cd command


IN PWD COMMAND
help 	tells in brief about the pwd command
